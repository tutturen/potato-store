# GraphQL API Documentation #

The files in this directory serves as a human readable API documentation.
They are not used by any code, they are purely to reach an agreement for
our API specification.

For the ultimate, one and only, true API documentation, open the GraphQL
interface and click on "Docs" in the upper right corner.
